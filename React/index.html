<!-- react is a ui library. 
-used to built user interface.
-react is a js library,it's not a framework
-we have to load third party library for react router
-react gives flexibility to create our component more quickly,easily
-react is made up of jsx-we will write the code mix with js and html in one file(js&external html)
-for writing code in reactjs we need one kind of transpiler which converts jsx code to js and hml language.
bacause browser understands onl html,css,js
-babel-transpiler-converts from jsx->js
-react maintains one vdom,if we change something in real dom it's a expensive process
-so for this it's maintain a duplicate copy of RDOM that is VDOM and it first tries to update VDOM,
,and runs one algorithm that is diffing algorithm ,it checks which part of node is updated in vdom.
only that part update in real dom 
-in react we will create everything as a component so that we can reuse it
when we update the data,the react will re-render everytime-->

reactdom jsx interpreted into 2 funs 1.crated div,2.appended div inside body
in react we no need to write create,append.. reactdom will take care of it.
here we are writing jsx code
